Soldering Practice Board
========================

Please see the Docs/ directory for a bill of materials with digikey and
element14 part numbers, plus an oshpark rendering of the front and back of the
board.

Thanks!

I couldn't bring myself to just drop components on a board and have them not
do anything, so this board will (hopefully!) blink 8 LEDs in two alternating
groups of four.

The circuit is pretty convoluted, just to increase the part count and the
number of different footprints used:

* 0603 (8 components)
* 0805 (15 components)
* 1206 (8 components))
* SOT23 (4 components)
* SOIC8 (1 component)
* TSSOP14 (1 component)
* MSOP (2 components)
* Through-hole (3 components)
